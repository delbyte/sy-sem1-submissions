# Vedic Mathematics Assignments

## Assignment 1

### Question 1

**Imagine you have a math problem. Vedic Mathematics offers different ways to solve it. Choose two Vedic Sutras. For each Sutra, describe how it works. Then, give a clear example for each showing how using that Vedic method is better (faster, simpler, etc.) than what you learned in school for that specific calculation. Briefly touch on the historical importance of Vedic Mathematics.**

#### Theory

Vedic Mathematics is a collection of techniques to solve mathematical problems in a fast and easy way. It is based on 16 sutras, or word-formulae, and 13 sub-sutras. These sutras are short, simple, and easy to remember, and they cover a wide range of topics in mathematics.

Two important sutras are:
1.  **Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah (All from 9 and the last from 10):** This sutra is used for subtraction and multiplication of numbers that are close to a base (like 10, 100, 1000, etc.).
2.  **Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam (Vertically and Crosswise):** This is a general method for multiplication that can be applied to any two numbers.

#### Solution

**Sutra 1: Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah**

This sutra is very effective for multiplying numbers close to a power of 10. Let's take the example of multiplying $96 \times 98$.

*   **Conventional Method:**
    ```
      96
    x 98
    ----
     768
    9440
    ----
    9408
    ```

*   **Vedic Method (Nikhilam):**
    1.  The base is 100.
    2.  The differences from the base are $96 - 100 = -4$ and $98 - 100 = -2$.
    3.  The right part of the answer is the product of the differences: $(-4) \times (-2) = 8$. Since the base is 100, we write this as 08.
    4.  The left part of the answer is the cross-subtraction: $96 - 2 = 94$ or $98 - 4 = 94$.
    5.  The answer is 9408.

The Vedic method is clearly faster and requires less mental calculation.

**Sutra 2: Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam**

This sutra provides a general method for multiplication. Let's multiply $47 \times 38$.

*   **Conventional Method:**
    ```
      47
    x 38
    ----
     376
    1410
    ----
    1786
    ```

*   **Vedic Method (Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam):**
    1.  **Step 1 (Vertically):** Multiply the rightmost digits: $7 \times 8 = 56$. Write down 6 and carry over 5.
    2.  **Step 2 (Crosswise):** Multiply the digits crosswise and add: $(4 \times 8) + (7 \times 3) + 5 (carry) = 32 + 21 + 5 = 58$. Write down 8 and carry over 5.
    3.  **Step 3 (Vertically):** Multiply the leftmost digits and add the carry: $(4 \times 3) + 5 (carry) = 12 + 5 = 17$. Write down 17.
    4.  The answer is 1786.

This method is also very efficient and can be performed mentally with some practice.

**Historical Importance:**
Vedic Mathematics was rediscovered from ancient Indian scriptures by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji in the early 20th century. It is believed to be a part of the Sthapatya-Veda, an appendix to the Atharva Veda. The system's simplicity and elegance have made it popular worldwide as a tool for faster mental calculations.

## Assignment 2

### Question 1: Multiplication Methods

**a) Solve the multiplication problem $47 \times 38$ using the Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam method. Show all steps.**

#### Theory
The Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam sutra means "Vertically and Crosswise". It is a general multiplication method that simplifies the process by breaking it down into vertical and crosswise multiplications.

#### Solution
1.  **Step 1 (Rightmost digits, vertically):** $7 \times 8 = 56$. Write 6, carry 5.
2.  **Step 2 (Crosswise):** $(4 \times 8) + (7 \times 3) = 32 + 21 = 53$. Add the carry: $53 + 5 = 58$. Write 8, carry 5.
3.  **Step 3 (Leftmost digits, vertically):** $4 \times 3 = 12$. Add the carry: $12 + 5 = 17$. Write 17.
4.  The result is 1786.

**b) Solve the multiplication problem $996 \times 992$ using the Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah method. Show all steps.**

#### Theory
The Nikhilam sutra is used for numbers near a base. We find the deviation from the base, multiply the deviations for the right part of the answer, and cross-add/subtract for the left part.

#### Solution
1.  **Base:** 1000.
2.  **Deviations:** $996 - 1000 = -4$, $992 - 1000 = -8$.
3.  **Right Part:** Product of deviations: $(-4) \times (-8) = 32$. Since the base has 3 zeros, we write 032.
4.  **Left Part:** Cross-subtraction: $996 - 8 = 988$ or $992 - 4 = 988$.
5.  The result is 988032.

**c) Compare the efficiency and ease of use between these two Vedic multiplication methods for the specific problems given. When would you prefer one over the other?**

#### Solution
*   **Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam** is a general method, applicable to any numbers. It is very efficient for smaller numbers.
*   **Nikhilam** is a special method, highly efficient for numbers close to a base. For $996 \times 992$, Nikhilam is much faster and simpler than Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam.
*   **Preference:** I would prefer Nikhilam when numbers are close to a power of 10, and Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam for all other cases.

### Question 2: Squares and Cubes

**a) Calculate the square of 73 using the Duplex method. Show all steps.**

#### Theory
The Duplex method, or *Dvandva Yoga*, is a special application of the Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam sutra for squaring numbers. The duplex of a number is calculated as follows:
*   For a single digit 'a', $D(a) = a^2$.
*   For two digits 'ab', $D(ab) = 2ab$.
*   For three digits 'abc', $D(abc) = 2ac + b^2$.

#### Solution
1.  **Duplex of 3:** $D(3) = 3^2 = 9$.
2.  **Duplex of 73:** $D(73) = 2 \times 7 \times 3 = 42$.
3.  **Duplex of 7:** $D(7) = 7^2 = 49$.
4.  **Combine the results:**
    *   Write down 9.
    *   From 42, write down 2 and carry 4.
    *   Add the carry to 49: $49 + 4 = 53$.
    *   The result is 5329.

**b) Calculate the cube of 13 using the Anurupyena Sutra. Show all steps.**

#### Theory
The *Anurupyena* sutra means "proportionality". It is used for finding cubes of numbers. We set up a ratio and create four columns.

#### Solution
1.  **Ratio:** The ratio of the digits is 1:3.
2.  **Four Columns:**
    *   First column: $1^3 = 1$.
    *   Second column: $1^2 \times 3 = 3$.
    *   Third column: $1 \times 3^2 = 9$.
    *   Fourth column: $3^3 = 27$.
3.  **Double the middle two columns:** $3 \times 2 = 6$, $9 \times 2 = 18$.
4.  **Add the columns:**
    ```
      1   3   9   27
          6  18
      ----------------
      1   9  27   27
    ```
5.  **Combine the results:**
    *   Write 7, carry 2.
    *   $27 + 2 = 29$. Write 9, carry 2.
    *   $9 + 2 = 11$. Write 1, carry 1.
    *   $1 + 1 = 2$.
    *   The result is 2197.

**c) For each of these (squaring and cubing), briefly explain how the Vedic technique simplifies the process compared to direct multiplication.**

#### Solution
*   **Squaring:** The Duplex method avoids the need for long multiplication. It breaks down the problem into smaller, manageable steps that can be done mentally.
*   **Cubing:** The Anurupyena sutra is much more systematic than direct multiplication ($13 \times 13 \times 13$). It reduces the cognitive load and minimizes the chances of error.

## Assignment 3

### Question 1: Vedic Divisibility Rules

**List out the Vedic Divisibility Rules with stepwise explanations for divisibility by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13.**

#### Theory
Vedic divisibility rules are based on the concept of osculators. An osculator is a number that, when multiplied by the last digit of a number and added to or subtracted from the rest of the number, helps determine divisibility.

#### Solution
*   **Divisibility by 2, 5, 10:** Use the sutra *Antyayoreva* (Only the last digits).
*   **Divisibility by 3, 9:** Use the sutra *Sankalanam-Vyavakalanambhyam* (by addition and by subtraction). Sum the digits.
*   **Divisibility by 4:** Check if the last two digits are divisible by 4.
*   **Divisibility by 7:** The osculator is -2. For a number $10a+b$, check if $a-2b$ is divisible by 7.
*   **Divisibility by 11:** Use *Sankalanam-Vyavakalanambhyam*. The difference between the sum of digits at odd and even places should be 0 or a multiple of 11.
*   **Divisibility by 13:** The osculator is 4. For a number $10a+b$, check if $a+4b$ is divisible by 13.

### Question 2: Solving Problems using Vedic Divisibility Rules

**Solve the following problems using Vedic Divisibility Rules.**

#### Solution
*   **1326 by 3:** $1+3+2+6=12$. 12 is divisible by 3. So, 1326 is divisible by 3.
*   **1326 by 13:** $132 + 4 \times 6 = 156$. $15 + 4 \times 6 = 39$. 39 is divisible by 13. So, 1326 is divisible by 13.
*   **7722 by 9:** $7+7+2+2=18$. 18 is divisible by 9. So, 7722 is divisible by 9.
*   **7722 by 11:** $(7+2) - (7+2) = 0$. So, 7722 is divisible by 11.
*   **1196 by 4:** 96 is divisible by 4. So, 1196 is divisible by 4.
*   **1729 by 7:** $172 - 2 \times 9 = 154$. $15 - 2 \times 4 = 7$. 7 is divisible by 7. So, 1729 is divisible by 7.

## Assignment 4

### Question 1: HCF of Polynomials

**Find HCF of the polynomials using *Lopana-Sthapanabhyam* (by elimination and retention).**

#### Theory
This method involves systematically eliminating the first and last terms of the polynomials through addition and subtraction to find common factors.

#### Solution
1.  $P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2$, $Q(x) = x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4$
    *   $P(x) - Q(x) = 3x^2 + 3x - 6 = 3(x^2+x-2)$.
    *   $4P(x) + Q(x) = 5x^3 + 7x^2 - 8x - 4$.
    *   The HCF must be a factor of $x^2+x-2 = (x+2)(x-1)$.
    *   Checking these factors in P(x) and Q(x), we find that both are factors.
    *   HCF = $x^2+x-2$.

2.  $P(x) = x^3 - 4x$, $Q(x) = x^2 - 4$
    *   $P(x) = x(x^2-4)$.
    *   The HCF is clearly $x^2-4$.

### Question 2: Polynomial Multiplication

**Polynomial multiplication using *Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam*.**

#### Theory
The same vertically and crosswise method used for numbers can be applied to polynomials by using their coefficients.

#### Solution
1.  $(x^2+2x+1)(x+3)$
    *   Coefficients: (1, 2, 1) and (0, 1, 3).
    *   $x^3$ term: $1 \times 1 = 1$.
    *   $x^2$ term: $(1 \times 3) + (2 \times 1) = 5$.
    *   $x$ term: $(2 \times 3) + (1 \times 1) = 7$.
    *   Constant term: $1 \times 3 = 3$.
    *   Result: $x^3 + 5x^2 + 7x + 3$.

### Question 3: Polynomial Division

**Polynomial division using *Paravartya Yojayet* (Transpose and Apply).**

#### Theory
This is a method for dividing polynomials where the divisor is a simple linear expression. We transpose the coefficients of the divisor and proceed with a simple division process.

#### Solution
1.  $(x^2 + 5x + 6) \div (x + 2)$
    *   Divisor is $x+2$. Transposed divisor is $-2$.
    *   ```
          -2 | 1   5   6
             |    -2  -6
             ----------------
               1   3   0
        ```
    *   Quotient: $x+3$, Remainder: $0$.

## Assignment 5

### Question 1: Determinants

**Calculate the determinant using *Paravartya Sutra*.**

#### Theory
The Paravartya sutra can be applied to solve systems of linear equations, from which Cramer's rule and the concept of determinants arise. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is a straightforward cross-multiplication. For a 3x3 matrix, it's an extension of this process.

#### Solution
*   $\begin{vmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 4 \end{vmatrix} = (3 \times 4) - (2 \times 1) = 12 - 2 = 10$.
*   $\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 1 & 3 \\ 4 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 5 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = 2(4-5) - 1(8-1) + 3(20-2) = -2 - 7 + 54 = 45$.

### Question 2: Matrix Multiplication

**Matrix multiplication using *Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam*.**

#### Theory
The vertically and crosswise method can be extended to matrix multiplication.

#### Solution
$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}, B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{pmatrix}$
*   $C_{11} = (1 \times 5) + (2 \times 7) = 19$.
*   $C_{12} = (1 \times 6) + (2 \times 8) = 22$.
*   $C_{21} = (3 \times 5) + (4 \times 7) = 43$.
*   $C_{22} = (3 \times 6) + (4 \times 8) = 50$.
*   $C = \begin{pmatrix} 19 & 22 \\ 43 & 50 \end{pmatrix}$.

## Assignment 6

### Question 1: Quadratic Equations

**a) Solve using *Anurupyena* and *Adyamadyenantyamantya*.**

#### Theory
*Adyamadyenantyamantya* means "the first by the first and the last by the last". It's a factorization method.

#### Solution
1.  $x^2 - 11x + 28 = 0$. We need two numbers whose sum is -11 and product is 28. These are -4 and -7. So, $(x-4)(x-7)=0$. $x=4, 7$.
2.  $5x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0$. Product is $5 \times 6 = 30$, sum is 13. Numbers are 10 and 3.
    $5x^2 + 10x + 3x + 6 = 5x(x+2) + 3(x+2) = (5x+3)(x+2)=0$. $x=-3/5, -2$.

**b) Solve using *Puranapuranabhyam* (by the completion of the square).**

#### Theory
This sutra provides a method for completing the square to solve quadratic equations.

#### Solution
1.  $2x^2 - x - 6 = 0 \implies x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x - 3 = 0$.
    $(x - \frac{1}{4})^2 = 3 + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{49}{16} \implies x - \frac{1}{4} = \pm \frac{7}{4}$.
    $x = 2, -3/2$.

## Assignment 7

### Question 1: Magic Squares

**Solve the magic squares.**

#### Theory
A magic square is a square grid where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. This sum is called the magic constant.

#### Solution
1.  **Sum = 30:** The missing numbers can be found by subtracting the sum of the known numbers in a row/column from 30.
2.  **Magic square with 'x':** The magic constant is $x-1+x-3+k = 2x-4+k$. There seems to be missing information or a typo in the problem as presented in the image.
3.  **Decimal magic square:** The magic constant is 4.5. The missing numbers can be found by subtraction.

### Question 2: Dates and Calendars

**Calendar Problems.**

#### Theory
Calendar problems involve calculating the day of the week for a given date. This is done by counting the number of "odd days". An odd day is a day of the week that is in excess of a complete week.

#### Solution
1.  **15th August 1947:** This is a famous date in Indian history, and the day was Friday.
2.  **31st Dec 2000 (Sunday) to 2nd Jan 2005:** We count the odd days for the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004. This gives a total of 5 odd days. So, 31st Dec 2004 was a Friday. 2nd Jan 2005 was a Sunday.
3.  **1st Jan 2099 (Thursday) to 1st Jan 2101:** 2099 and 2100 are not leap years. So, we have 2 odd days. The day will be Saturday.
4.  **10 February 1948:** 1948 was a leap year. Calculating from a reference date, the day was a Tuesday.

## Assignment 8

### Question 1: Numerical Methods

**Solving equations using *Sunyam Samasamuccaye*.**

#### Theory
This sutra means "when the sum is the same, that sum is zero". It is used for solving certain types of equations.

#### Solution
The problems given, $\frac{x+3}{x+5} = \frac{2x+6}{2x+10}$ and $\frac{x-2}{x-4} = \frac{3x-6}{3x-12}$, are identities. They are true for all values of x for which the expressions are defined.

### Question 2: Approximations

**Approximations for roots.**

#### Theory
Vedic mathematics provides simple methods for approximating square roots. For $\sqrt{N}$, we find a perfect square $a^2$ close to N, and use the formula $\sqrt{N} \approx a + \frac{N-a^2}{2a}$.

#### Solution
*   $\sqrt{10} = \sqrt{9+1} \approx 3 + \frac{1}{2 \times 3} = 3.166...$
*   $\sqrt{41} = \sqrt{36+5} \approx 6 + \frac{5}{2 \times 6} = 6.416...$

## Assignment 9

### Question 1: Differentiation

**Find the derivative of $x^2 - 9x + 14$.**

#### Theory
The sutra *Sankalana-Vyavakalanabhyam* can be interpreted in the context of calculus to find derivatives. However, the standard power rule is often the most direct method.

#### Solution
Using the power rule, the derivative is $2x - 9$.

### Question 2: Differentiation

**Differentiate $f(x) = x^2+3x+2$.**

#### Solution
The derivative is $f'(x) = 2x+3$.

## Assignment 10

### Question 1: Coordinate Geometry

**Derive the distance formula.**

#### Theory
The distance formula is a direct application of the Pythagorean theorem in a coordinate plane.

#### Solution
For two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, we can form a right-angled triangle with sides of length $|x_2-x_1|$ and $|y_2-y_1|$. The distance 'd' between the points is the hypotenuse. By Pythagoras' theorem, $d^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2$, so $d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.

### Question 2: Equation of a Circle

**Expand $(x-13)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 169$ using the Duplex method.**

#### Theory
The Duplex method can be used to square the binomials.

#### Solution
*   $(x-13)^2 = x^2 - 2(13x) + 13^2 = x^2 - 26x + 169$.
*   $(y+6)^2 = y^2 + 2(6y) + 6^2 = y^2 + 12y + 36$.
*   The expanded equation is $x^2 - 26x + 169 + y^2 + 12y + 36 = 169$.
*   $x^2 + y^2 - 26x + 12y + 36 = 0$.

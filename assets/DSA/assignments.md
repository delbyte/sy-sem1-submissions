# Lab Assignmnents

Group A  
1. You have been given an array of positive integers A1,A2,...,An with length N and you  
have to print an array of same length(N) where the values in the new array are the sum of  
every number in the array, except the number at that index. Write program in Python  
Language. Write a C++ Program 
2. Write a python program to compute following computation on matrix 
a. Addition of two matrices 
b. Subtraction of two matrices 
c. Multiplication of two matrices 
d. Transpose of two matrices 
3. Write a C++ program to perform sparce matrix addition and transpose 
Group B 
1. Write a C++ / python program for Linear Search and Binary Search. Plot graph of  
the time taken by both the program using tool like gnuplot. 
2. Design and implement an algorithm that will find the top and the least scores of  
students from an online Quiz. Note: The scores are stored in an array. Expected time  
complexity is in O(nlogn). 
3. Write C++ program to for insertion and selection sort
Group C 
1. Write C++ Program Write a C++ program to implement a singly link list and  
perform operations such as insert, delete, display, search element from it and reverse  
the list(Find middle node of linked list)  
2. Write C++ Program for doubly circular link list and perform operations such as  
insert, delete, display, search element from it. 
3. Write a C++ program for storing binary number using doubly linked lists. Write  
function to compute 1‟s and 2‟s complement.  
Group D 
1. Write a C++ program to evaluate an infix expression, without converting it to  
postfix. The input string can have spaces, (, ) and precedence of operators should be  
handled. 
2. Given an expression with only } and { . The expression may not be balanced. Find  
minimum number of bracket reversals to make the expression balance. 
Group E 
1. Implement Queue using linked list. 
2. You are given an array A [] of size N and an integer K. Your task is to print the minimum  
element for each sub array of size 'k'. In other words, for each Valid Index i (0 <= i <= N - K)  
You have to print min(A[i], A[i + 1], A[i + 2] .... A [i + k]). 
3. Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served  
basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system  
using circular queue using array.
